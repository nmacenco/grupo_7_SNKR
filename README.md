Reference pages:

https://www.grid.com.ar/: Currently one of the main pages in Argentina dedicated to the retail sale of sports clothing and footwear, a great reference for the audience we are targeting. It has a good yellow aesthetic based on its logo, which could be useful in case of choosing a logo color.

https://www.dafiti.com.ar/: It is related to the product we chose and also has all the elements that we have planned to implement. It is a great reference.

https://www.converse.com.ar/: Although the page does not have online sales, we thought it was a reference in the sneaker market. We liked the simplicity of the site.

https://drifters.com.ar/: Clothing sales platform with a large offer in the footwear sector, which is our focus. Its navigation is intuitive and we found it suitable to have as a reference and take some ideas.

https://www.moovbydexter.com.ar/: Along with Grid, it currently has the largest sneakerhead audience due to its exclusive releases, mostly recognized for its sneakers. It has a minimalist Black&White design with very neat and pleasant animations for the end-user, which we can use as a guide.
